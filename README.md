# ANU MSP Question Bank

A free, community-driven MCQ practice platform built for ANU MSP students —
browse the official curriculum by year/module/subject/lecture, take timed
quizzes, track your stats, and build or share your own quizzes. Admins can
publish official question sets and use built-in AI tools (Google Gemini) to
extract questions from lecture slides, generate new ones, auto-answer, and
write explanations.

It's a single-page app: no backend server, no build step. Firebase
(Auth + Firestore) handles accounts, data storage, and syncing; everything
else is plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

> Open source and free to fork. See [Getting started](#getting-started) to
> stand up your own copy with your own Firebase project.

## Features

- **Curriculum browser** — Year → Module → Subject → Lecture, with a
  timed quiz mode, question navigator, flagging, and a results screen.
- **Persistent statistics** — per-user history stored in Firestore.
- **Custom quizzes** — write your own, or generate one from pasted MCQs
  or lecture material using Gemini.
- **Community quizzes** — browse, take, and share quizzes made by other
  students; merge questions from one quiz into another.
- **AI tools** (Gemini, bring-your-own API key) — extract questions from
  slides/PDFs, generate new questions, auto-answer, refine question
  wording, fill in missing choices, and produce step-by-step explanations
  or a per-question AI chat.
  - Extraction/generation runs (⏸️ Pause / ▶️ Resume / ⏹ Stop) cover the
    whole pipeline — extraction, AI answering, Fill Choices, and Refine
    Questions all share one cancel token, so ⏹ Stop aborts whichever of
    those is currently running, immediately, not just at the next
    checkpoint. While ⏸️ Pause is waiting for its next natural checkpoint
    (between files/batches/questions), a "⏭️ pause now" option lets you
    skip that wait and step back to the last completed checkpoint instead
    — the in-progress file/batch/question is simply retried once you
    press ▶️ Resume, nothing already done is lost.
  - Every Gemini request the app makes — extraction, AI Solve, Fill
    Choices, Refine Questions, explanations, chat — shares one global
    pacing clock (`GEMINI_MIN_REQUEST_SPACING_MS` in `gemini-uploads.js`),
    so the app self-throttles under Google's free-tier rate cap (~10–15
    requests/minute per project) even when several bulk tools are running
    at once across different editors. If your key is on a paid tier with
    a much higher limit, that constant can be safely lowered.
  - The whole uploaded PDF/image is always sent to Gemini in a single
    request (never split page-by-page), and the extraction prompt
    (`CQ_EXTRACTION_PROMPT` in `gemini-uploads.js`) explicitly tells the
    model to treat the document as one continuous flow — so a question
    whose stem, answer choices, or answer key spans a page break gets
    merged correctly instead of being truncated or dropped. The prompt
    also expects pages to mix portrait and landscape orientation (or be
    entirely one or the other) — a PDF doesn't need to be pre-formatted
    into a single uniform orientation for extraction to work correctly.
- **Admin panel** — publish quizzes into the official bank, manage the
  curriculum tree (years/modules/subjects), manage other admins and their
  permissions, and edit/split/reorder published lectures.
- **Offline-friendly caching** — curriculum and published questions are
  cached locally and versioned so returning users don't re-fetch
  everything on every visit.

## Tech stack

- Vanilla HTML / CSS / JavaScript (no framework, no bundler)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) — Authentication (Google
  sign-in) and Firestore (database)
- [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) — optional, powers all AI
  features; each user supplies their own API key, stored locally in
  their browser

The JavaScript is split by feature area rather than converted into ES
modules — every file (except `firebase-init.js`) still shares one global
scope, exactly like the original single-file app, so no behavior changed
during the split. `firebase-init.js` is the only ES module, since it needs
`import` to load the Firebase SDK and your config.

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and configure Firebase

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/anu-msp-question-bank.git
cd anu-msp-question-bank
cp js/config/firebase-config.example.js js/config/firebase-config.js
```

Then:

1. Create a project at the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. **Authentication** → Sign-in method → enable **Google**.
3. **Firestore Database** → create a database (production mode), then
   paste the contents of [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules) into
   the Rules tab. This is the actual ruleset this app runs on — it
   enforces per-user ownership on personal data (stats, custom quizzes,
   profiles), public read access to the published question bank, and a
   roster-based (`curriculum` / `community` / `admins`) permission model
   for everything admin-only. If you fork this project, update the
   hardcoded `isSuperAdmin()` email at the top to your own account before
   deploying.
4. **Project settings → General → Your apps** → add a Web app, and copy
   the generated config object into `js/config/firebase-config.js`.

`firebase-config.js` is listed in `.gitignore`, so your keys never get
committed.

### 2. Run it locally

No build step is required — it's static files. Any local web server works,
for example:

```bash
npm run dev
# or: npx serve .
# or: python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

### 3. Make yourself an admin

The super-admin email is checked in **two places**, and both must match:

- `js/app-core.js` — the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` constant (client-side UI gating)
- `firestore.rules` — the `isSuperAdmin()` function (server-side enforcement)

Update both to your own Google account email before deploying. That
account will always have full admin permissions (publishing quizzes,
managing the curriculum, and managing other admins) and can grant
permissions to other accounts from the in-app **Admin Panel** afterward.
Non-super admins get their permissions from the `appConfig/adminRoster`
Firestore document, which the Admin Panel manages for you.

### 4. (Optional) Add your own Gemini API key

AI features are opt-in per user — each person adds their own key from
the app's **Manage APIs** button (Google AI Studio issues free keys at
[aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)). Nothing
AI-related is required for the core quiz/browsing experience to work.

> **Note on key formats:** since mid-2026 Google AI Studio issues new Gemini
> keys as "Auth keys" (prefixed `AQ.`, replacing the older `AIza...`
> "Standard key" format — see [Google's key docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)).
> Both formats work with this app: every Gemini request sends the key via
> the `x-goog-api-key` HTTP header (Google's documented method) rather than
> the old `?key=` URL parameter, which is unreliable for Auth keys.

## Adding questions

Questions are stored in Firestore, not hardcoded, so the primary way to
add them is through the app itself once you're an admin:

- **Admin Panel → Publish** a custom or community quiz into a chosen
  Module/Subject/Lecture, or
- **Admin Panel → Manage Curriculum** to create the Year/Module/Subject
  structure first, then publish into it.

Every question follows this shape:

```js
{
  question: "The question text",
  image: "https://example.com/image.png", // optional
  options: { A: "...", B: "...", C: "...", D: "..." },
  answer: "A" // must match one of the option keys
}
```

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — whether that's bug fixes, UI
polish, new AI-tool integrations, or accessibility improvements. Please
keep the file-per-feature layout above when adding new functionality
rather than growing one of the existing files indefinitely.
